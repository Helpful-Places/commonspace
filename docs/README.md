## About CommonSpace
CommonSpace is a map-based data collection mobile application that makes it easier to record observations of human activities in open spaces — a method known as public life studies. Public life studies are used to develop a better understanding of how public spaces serve the needs of people and communities.

People who are interested in conducting a public life study — city planners, designers, community groups, etc — can create a study using a web portal for CommonSpace. A study organizer begins by defining their research question, and then configuring the needed observations into the app.
Then, they recruit surveyors to conduct the study, who are assigned “shifts” in the public space under study. The surveyors spend time in the space and use the CommonSpace mobile app to record data about what they observe at defined intervals to capture a snapshot of public life activity. CommonSpace implements an open data standard known as the Public Life Data Protocol.

Afterwards, study organizers are able to download the data, and are able select a toggle to post their study and publish the underlying data on a public data portal.

## Why we built CommonSpace
A people-first public realm starts with knowing and understanding how our shared spaces function. Understanding how people use parks, plazas, and neighbourhood spaces enables students, researchers, communities, and governments alike to understand the impact of design and programming on public life. Public life data can support civic action, policy revisions and decision-making that affect how spaces are designed, built, operated and programmed.

However, the complexity of preparing a public life study can be a barrier to understanding how our public spaces work. The objective of CommonSpace is to make it easier to conduct these types of studies. Our hope is to enable all types of people to use public life data in their work, from research to planning to civic engagement.

CommonSpace builds on a decades-long tradition of using data to understand how people interact with parks and public spaces in order to improve quality of life. CommonSpace implements the Public Life Data Protocol,  a data standard published by Gehl Institute, in partnership with Copenhagen, San Francisco, Seattle and the Gehl practice, to standardize the data collection process, support evaluating the impact of public spaces,  and enable new innovations in making cities for and with people.

## The Public Life Data Protocol
**From Gehl Institute** (https://gehlinstitute.org/tool/public-life-data-protocol/)

> The Public Life Data Protocol (the Protocol) describes a set of metrics that are important to the understanding of public life—people moving and staying in public space—and aims to establish a common format for the collection and storage of such data. Used in conjunction with the Public Life Data Tools or other observational methods for collecting data about people in public space, the Protocol provides the structure for the data you collect.

> Based on four decades of research and application of data about public life to shape public policy, planning, and urban design, the Protocol is an open data specification intended to improve the ability of everyone to share and compare information about public life activity in public space. In recent years, practitioners and cities have incorporated people-centered metrics and public life data into their engineering models, investment decisions, and design choices. These methods, based on decades of research, have now been applied in hundreds of cities around the world. There is tremendous potential to make public life datasets more compatible, scalable, and comparable across different cities and regions.


## Pilot in Thorncliffe Park 
CommonSpace was co-developed and field-tested with three partner organizations: Gehl Institute, Park People, and the Thorncliffe Park Women's Committee.
* **Gehl Institute** (https://gehlinstitute.org/) is a non profit with the mission to transform the way cities are shaped by making public life an intentional driver for design, policy, and governance. Their work has included the publication of a number of tools and worksheets that make it easier to design and conduct public life studies. In 2017, they partnered with the Gehl practice, Copenhagen Municipality, San Francisco City Planning, and Seattle Department of Transportation to public the Public Life Data Protocol, a data standard for collecting public life data.
* **Park People** (https://parkpeople.ca/) is a non profit that helps people activate the power of parks in cities across Canada, and they are experienced in designing and running public life studies in Toronto. In 2018, they launched the Public Space Incubator program that awarded grants to support projects that re-imagine Toronto's public spaces. 
* **The Thorncliffe Park Women's Committee (TPWC)** (https://www.tpwomenscomm.org/) is a non profit grassroots organization dedicated to creating and implementing public space enhancement projects in the community of Thorncliffe Park, and over the past decade they have created a vibrant public market and cafe in their neighborhood park, RV Burgess Park. They are a recipient of funding from Park People's Public Space Incubator program.

In September 2018, under the supervision of Park People, TPWC conducted the first public life study using CommonSpace. Their research questions focused on the effect of programming in the park and on the impact of adding more tables and chairs near the cafe.
